# Cisco-ISE-Device-Export-Script
Export all Cisco ISE devices using curl to enumerate the ERS REST API.

This is a quick PERL script that enumerates the Cisco ISE ERS API using CURL to dump all devices from Cisco ISE.

PREREQUISITES are:  1. Have perl 5.x   and have CURL with it also being in your PATH.

Tested on REDHAT 7.
